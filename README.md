# Project 3: Spots

**Intro**

Spots is a responsive profile page for a photo-sharing application, built to translate a static Figma design into a flexible, real-world webpage. The project focuses on creating a layout that adapts smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes (320px and up) while maintaining visual consistency and usability.

The page was built using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques, including Flexbox and CSS Grid, to handle layout structure and responsiveness. Media queries were used to manage breakpoints, and BEM methodology was applied to keep styles organized and maintainable. Special attention was given to alignment, spacing, hover states, and text overflow to ensure the UI remains clean even with long or unpredictable content.
